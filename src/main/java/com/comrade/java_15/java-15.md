# Java - 15
## Sealed Classes and Interfaces

## Sealed Classes : A sealed class is a class or interface that restricts which other classes or interfaces may extend.
### In Java, by default, there is no restriction on a class which public interfaces it can impliment.Since Java 15, now a class or interface can be declared sealed class or sealed interface using the modifier sealed. 
### A sealed class or interface restricts which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them. Conceptually, it is a more declarative way than access modifiers to restrict the use of a class or interface as a parent class or as a parent interface.
