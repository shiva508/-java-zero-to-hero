# Compile-Time Polymorphism

## It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.

# Method Overloading

## When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded.
## Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.
### same method name different number of parameters,
### same method name different data type of parameters,

Subtypes of Compile-time Polymorphism:
i. Function Overloading

It is a feature in C++ where multiple functions can have the same name but with different parameter lists. The compiler will decide which function to call based on the number and types of arguments passed to the function.
ii. Operator Overloading

It is a feature in C++ where the operators such as +, -, *, etc. can be given additional meanings when applied to user-defined data types.
iii. Template

it is a powerful feature in C++ that allows us to write generic functions and classes. A template is a blueprint for creating a family of functions or classes.
