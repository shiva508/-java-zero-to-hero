It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in which a function call to the overridden 
method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. Method overriding,
on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. 
That base function is said to be overridden.
