# Solid Principles
### The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.
## The Single Responsibility Principle
### The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.
## Open-Closed Principle
### The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.
## Liskov Substitution Principle
### The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
## Interface Segregation Principle
### Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.
## Dependency Inversion Principle
### The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.
