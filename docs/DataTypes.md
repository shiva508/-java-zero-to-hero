# DataTypes
## byte
### The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127.
### The byte data type can be useful for saving memory in large arrays, where the memory savings actually matters. 
### They can also be used in place of int where their limits help to clarify your code.
## short
### The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767.
### The short data type can be useful for saving memory in large arrays, where the memory savings actually matters.
## int
### By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1.
### In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 232-1. 
### Use the Integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer.
## long
### The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -263 and a maximum value of 263-1. 
### In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the long data type to represent an unsigned 64-bit long, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 264-1. 
### Use this data type when you need a range of values wider than those provided by int.
## float
### The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
## double
### The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
## boolean 
### The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false. Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions. 
### This data type represents one bit of information, but its "size" isn't something that's precisely defined.
## char
### The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).
